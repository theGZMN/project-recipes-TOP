            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor 
                    or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is 
                    heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. 
                    Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 
                    2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and 
                    set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 
                    minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix 
                    and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and 
                    the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this 
                    point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken 
                    stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low 
                    heat for 15-30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook 
                    for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, 
                    mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!
