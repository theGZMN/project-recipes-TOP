                    <h4>Directions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Peel and wash your raw yam, dice them into cubes, not too tiny but not too large either
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Boil 2 cups of water till it’s hot, add a pinch of salt and add your diced yams. Boil for 15 minutes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a smaller pan, pour in a spoonful of palm oil, add sliced garlic, onions and let sauté for about two minutes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add your dry fish, dry prawns, blended pepper, salt and seasoning cubes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pour the sauce into the boiling pot filled with yam and stir well. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Let boil for another 5 to 10 minutes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Take a masher and mash two or three pieces of the yam in the porridge (this is optional of course; I just prefer it this way)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add your scent leaves and allow to simmer for 2-5 minutes or until porridge is soft with a creamy paste)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your porridge is ready, serve as you like and enjoy
                        </li>
