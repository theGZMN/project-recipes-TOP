            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Peel and wash your raw yam, dice them into cubes, not too tiny but not too large either
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boil 2 cups of water till it’s hot, add a pinch of salt and add your diced yams. Boil for 15 minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a smaller pan, pour in a spoonful of palm oil, add sliced garlic, onions and let sauté for about 
                    two minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add your dry fish, dry prawns, blended pepper, salt and seasoning cubes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the sauce into the boiling pot filled with yam and stir well. Taste and adjust seasoning 
                    if needed. Let boil for another 5 to 10 minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take a masher and mash two or three pieces of the yam in the porridge (this is optional of course; 
                    I just prefer it this way)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add your scent leaves and allow to simmer for 2-5 minutes or until porridge is soft with a creamy paste)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your porridge is ready, serve as you like and enjoy
                </li>
            </ol>
